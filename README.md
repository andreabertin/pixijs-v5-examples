# pixijs-v5-examples
Pixijs v5 examples with npm and webpack

Examples will be written in typescript, you can check webpack config files for its configuration.

Looking for source? Check *src* folder
Looging for assets? Check *build* folder
There will be a dedicated ts class for each example. 
If an example will be big enough to require more than one class then all class but starting one will be moved to a dedicated folder.
